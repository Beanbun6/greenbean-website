    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>At GreenBean Coffee, our journey begins in the heart of nature — where coffee is grown with love and care. Every bean starts on an organic farm, free from chemicals and full of life.</p>
    <p>From tree to bean, we nurture every step of the process. The coffee cherries are handpicked at peak ripeness, sun-dried naturally, and roasted in small batches to preserve their unique flavor.</p>
    <p>We believe in transparency, sustainability, and people-first practices. That means fair wages for our farmers, eco-friendly packaging, and a cup of coffee you can feel good about.</p>
    <p>What started as a small dream is now a growing community of coffee lovers who care — not just about taste, but about where their coffee comes from.</p>
    <p>This is more than coffee. This is GreenBean — rooted in purpose, brewed with passion.</p>
